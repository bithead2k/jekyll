A few people may have already read in my [github page](https://github.com/bithead2k) that I have been dabbling for some time in an attempt to get the psql client to use a much more modern prompt.  Preferrably the one from powerline-status, which is my personal favorite.

This started out as a simple weekend project, and turned into an odyssey of epic
proportions.  It included dragons, damsels, alternate universes, time travel and
finally some pixie dust.

And the journey isn't over.  Oh, no.  Not by a long shot.  It has only come
along just enough to ask the questions correctly, and demonstrate what I **wish** would happen.

For the impatient among you, the status so far is that I have a decent looking
prompt for a local psql client, but with a ton of caveats.

What I was aiming for looks like this:

![powerline bash](/jekyll/images/powerline_bash.png)

or this, maybe:

![powerline vim](/jekyll/images/powerline_vim.png)

The basic elements here are username, system, current context and last command
status.  The status is also displayed in a rather smooth terminal font.

The prompt changes based on the current connection, so some important
information is highlighted differently.  Notice that the privileged user `root`
is highlighted in red.

Some of these goals have been achieveable.  So far, the psql prompt looks like
this:

![powerline psql](/jekyll/images/powerline_psql.png)

Let me take you on a tour of what this prompt does, and then on to a list of
what it unfortunately doesn't do.

On the far left we have an indicator of the current editing mode.  My preferred
editor is Vim.  You may prefer some other form of suckage, but Vim hates me the
least, so deal with it.  The "+" plus indicator shows that Vim is currently in
insert mode.  If I were to press escape, it changes to a ":" colon.

Next to that, we have the currently logged in user "kroybal".

In square brackets, we have the database name followed by the port number "[~:5432]".  In
this case, the database is the same as the user name, so it is indicated with a
tilde "~".

What follows is a space for an indicator of transaction status.  When a
transaction is opened with "BEGIN;", this space will have an "\*" asterisk in
it.  When the transaction is closed with "END;", the space will return to being
blank.

The number after that is the current transaction id "5141".  This is a number that
PostgreSQL uses to maintain the transaction integrity.  It changes for every
login, as well as for every connection change (\c otherdb).

The next field shows the source of the connection.  In this case, a local unix
socket has been used to connect to the database, so the column shows "[local]".
For a TCP connection, this would show an IP or a machine name.

The following number is the pid of the backend process "333183" that is servicing the
connection.  Each front end client is served by a unique backend in the
PostgreSQL server, and this one is mine.

The last number "1", is the number of rows returned by the last query.  If the
previous query is not a type that returns any rows, it will simply be blank.

And finally, we have a user-sensitive prompt at the end.  At the moment, it is
showing a hash "#", because the kroybal user is a superuser.  Otherwise, it
would show something else.

So far, so good.  These are the things that I can get to function.  There are
several indicators that I would like to have that don't function, and some
limitations on the ones that do.

As to the limitations, let's start with the things that don't work at all.

First up on our list is that there is no way to run a query and output the
results into the prompt **dynamically**.  That is, a query can be run at startup
(more on that later), but the value doesn't change at any point in the future.
This is only useful for static display of something like a pid, which will
remain constant as long as we are attached to the backend.  There is no way to
show a value that changes (or can change) over time, such as a user assigned role, transaction
isolation level or other variable context.

There is no way to detect the status of the tty and react to it appropriately to
change the prompt formatting.  This is especially egregious when we connect to a
remote system.

![powerline failure](/jekyll/images/powerline_fail.png)

Oops. The prompt didn't survive the terminal connection.  Of course, this can be
fixed by setting up the tty more explicitly:

```bash
ssh -tt 192.168.254.187 psql -t
```

but who has time for those extra 4 keypresses?  Not me.  I am but a humble 50wpm
typist, and every keystroke is precious.

Then we have the issue that the prompt is not being formatted intelligently by
something like powerline-render.  It is simply some ANSI sequences combined
creatively with a font.  Better pythoneers than me would have to extend the
powerline-status package to understand the psql readline implementation
properly, and that's not for not-so-humble blog authors.  Se la vie.

And that wouldn't help anyway, because the psql client has no way to pass
parameters to a shell script in a PROMPT1.  That is, backticks "\`\`" work in a
psql prompt to invoke shell scripts, but there is currently no way to pass any
command line parameters to them.  Unfortunately, that means that there is no way
to call any formatting utility, even if you had one, which you don't because there
is no way to call one.  Aaargh.

Finally, there is no way to explicitly select the terminal font in the psql
prompt.  psql simply uses the current terminal font.  Unfortunately, this makes
the psql prompt and the terminal prompt look almost identical for the sake of my
demo.  There is a big difference between the terminal font and the vim status
line font, which makes them obvious and distinctive from one another.

Ok, that ends my rant for now.  Maybe one of the psql developers will hear my
plea for mercy.

For those that would like to follow my advancement so far, here are the relevant
files from my dotfiles collection to make it work (such as it is).

[inputrc](/jekyll/assets/inputrc)

[vimrc](/jekyll/assets/vimrc)

[psqlrc](/jekyll/assets/psqlrc)

The gobbledygook in the vimrc was generated by:

```bash
powerline-shell --shell bare
```

And then edited to place the psql parameters in there.
